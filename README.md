# Rhodes Game Jam 2024

So you want to do a game jam? Maybe you have a few questions and doubts. Lucky for you, I've been talking to my cat Pleakley about the game jam for a while now. I've transcribed our conversations, which you may find beneficial:

**Pleakley:** So what's a game jam?

**Jace:** A game jam is a short event, during which you design and create a complete game. You can do it alone, or with others. This game jam is going to be 48 hours, from **Friday, Nov 15 at 3 PM** to **Sunday, Nov 17 at 3 PM**. You can do it 100% remotely, although there will be snacks and support available at different times.

**Pleakley:** But I've never made a game before! I don't even know how to use a computer!!

**Jace:** Hah! That's ok, Pleakley. This game jam is for **all experience levels**. That means even you can participate. I've created a very simple starter game that you can play around with and turn into your own game.

**Pleakley:** Ok, fine, then what do I do to start?


## Step 1 (optional): Clone the Git Repository.

If you've never heard of git, be not afraid! Many people have figured out how to do this, and you can too. Use a search engine, ask a friend, or come see the **Game Jam Support Staff** during the jam, in the **basement of Briggs of RJ-B**. Here are instructions for cloning a repo ("the game") onto your own computer:

## Step 2 (optional): Download Godot

Godot is an open-source, community supported game engine. A game engine does all the "hard" work that we don't want to worry about, like collisions, physics, and graphics. You can download it here:

## Step 3 (optional): Learn Godot and GDScript

Godot has a high learning curve on its own. You will need to think about functions and data in the context of a **node hierarchy**, which is very similar to **object composition**, if you've learned about that. If you hit a roadblock, **the fastest thing to do is ask for help.** Here is the documentation:
