# Rhodes Game Jam 2024

So you want to do a game jam? Maybe you have a few questions and doubts. Lucky for you, I've been talking to my cat Pleakley about the game jam for a while now. I've transcribed our conversations, which you may find beneficial:

**Pleakley:** So what's a game jam?

**Jace:** A game jam is a short event, during which you design and create a complete game. You can do it alone, or with others. This game jam is going to be 48 hours, from **Friday, Nov 15 at 3 PM** to **Sunday, Nov 17 at 3 PM**. You can do it 100% remotely, although there will be snacks and support available at different times.

**Pleakley:** But I've never made a game before! I don't even know how to use a computer!!

**Jace:** Hah! That's ok, Pleakley. This game jam is for **all experience levels**. That means even you can participate.
